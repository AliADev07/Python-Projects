List of Python Projects - From Beginner to Advanced.

Beginner:----------------------------------------------------------
 Project #1 - Quiz Game:
    This Python script implements a simple quiz game where the player is asked a series of questions and earns points for correct answers. The game starts with a welcome message and prompts the player to choose whether they want to play. If the player chooses to play, they are asked a series of questions related to capitals, planets, literature, and art. For each question, the player's answer is compared with the correct answer, and points are awarded accordingly. At the end of the game, the player's final score out of 5 is displayed.


 Project #2 - Simple Calculator:
    This Python exercise involves creating a basic calculator program with menu options for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program continuously prompts the user for input, allowing them to perform calculations until they choose to exit. Key requirements include implementing functions for each operation, handling division by zero gracefully, and validating user input.


 Project #3 - Adventure Game:
    This Python exercise involves creating a simple text-based adventure game where the player makes choices that affect the outcome of the story. The player starts in a dark room with two doors, and they must choose between going left or right. Depending on their choice, they either win by finding treasure or lose by encountering a hungry lion. The game continues in a loop until the player decides to exit or until the game is over. The exercise emphasizes user input, conditional statements, and looping structures.


 Project #4 - Number Guessing Game:
    In this Python exercise, you'll create a number guessing game. The game generates a random number between 0 and 10, and the player has to guess the number. After each guess, the program provides feedback whether the guess was too high or too low. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.


 Project #5 - Rock, Paper, Scissors:
    In this Python exercise, you'll implement a simple rock, paper, scissors game where the player competes against the computer. The game continues until the player decides to exit.


 Project #6 - Palindrome Checker:
    In this Python exercise, you'll create a function called is_palindrome() that checks whether a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces and case).

 Project #7 - Alarm Clock:
 Project #8 - Password Generator:

 Project #9 - Password Managers (Most Advanced):
    This Python script implements a basic password manager using the Fernet encryption scheme from the cryptography library. It allows users to add new passwords or view existing ones.

 Project #10 - To-Do List Application:
    This Python script implements a basic To-Do List program where users can add, edit, mark tasks as completed, delete, and view tasks.
